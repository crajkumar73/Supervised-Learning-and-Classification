# Topic 1: Supervised Learning and Classification

The objective of this study is to use machine learning techniques to classify images of digits.  The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
The machine learning algorithm that will be used is the K-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) algorithm, which can be used for both classification and regression. It is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure.  k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally, and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.
